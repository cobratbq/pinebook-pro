# Pinebook Pro keyboard and touchpad firmware update utility

This utility updates the keyboard and trackpad firmware in the Pinebook Pro laptop, made by Pine64.  Both ANSI and ISO variants of the Pinebook Pro are supported.

**Please note that updating the firmware carries a small risk of permanently disabling the trackpad and keyboard, effectively bricking them.  Proceed at your own risk.**

## Compiling the utility

On Debian:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dragan-simic/pinebook-pro-keyboard-updater.git
cd pinebook-pro-keyboard-updater
sudo apt-get install build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev xxd
make
```

On Arch Linux or Manjaro ARM:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dragan-simic/pinebook-pro-keyboard-updater.git
cd pinebook-pro-keyboard-updater
sudo pacman -Syy base-devel libusb vim
make
```

Manjaro ARM provides a package that contains the firmware updater utility.  The name of the package is `pinebook-pro-keyboard-updater`, and the firmware update command is named `pbp-fwupdate`; thus, if you use the packaged version, replace `./updater` in the instructions below with `pbp-fwupdate`.  Please note that the Manjaro package provides no custom keymaps described later in this documentation.

## Pick the right keyboard variant

The Pinebook Pro exists in two keyboard variants, **ANSI** and **ISO**.  It is easy to determine the variant by the shape of the `Enter` key, for example.

**To update an ANSI variant of the Pinebook Pro, an external USB keyboard will be required because the built-in keyboard will stop working while the firmware update is performed.**

## Update all firmware images

You need to perform all update steps in the correct order; if the update process fails at any point, start it again from `step-1`.

Append your keyboard variant after the `step-2` command, specifying `ansi` or `iso`.  You will be given a chance to cancel the execution of `step-1` or `step-2`, but all steps must be eventually completed in the correct order.

These are the required steps:

1. Run `step-1` of the update process, which is the same for both keyboard variants: `sudo ./updater step-1`.
1. After `step-1`, the touchpad **will not work**, but the keyboard will continue to work normally on the **ISO** variant (the **ANSI** keyboard will not work after `step-1`).
1. Power your Pinebook Pro off with `sudo poweroff`, then power it on again.
1. After booting up, run `step-2 ansi` or `step-2 iso` of the update process, depending on the keyboard variant: `sudo ./updater step-2 ansi` or `sudo ./updater step-2 iso`.
1. Power your Pinebook Pro off with `sudo poweroff`, then power it on again.
1. After booting up, your keyboard and touchpad firmware should be updated.

### Revised keyboard firmware

There has been some effort in [`firmware/`](firmware/) to reverse-engineer and customise the existing firmware, fixing some of the common issues people are facing. **Currently you need to flash this after `step-1` and `step-2` with a separate command**, `flash-kb` followed by the `.hex` file location. No power cycling is required after flashing, but may be needed if your keyboard/touchpad is unresponsive (currently rare). Source code for each version can be found in [`firmware/src/`](firmware/src/).

Download and compile the firmware updater using the instructions already available at the start of this documentation.

For the ANSI variant of the Pinebook Pro:

```bash
# Execute step-1
sudo ./updater step-1
sudo poweroff

# Turn your Pinebook Pro on again, then run step-2
sudo ./updater step-2 ansi
sudo poweroff

# Turn it on again, then update to the revised ANSI firmware
sudo ./updater flash-kb firmware/default_ansi.hex
```

For the ISO variant of the Pinebook Pro:

```bash
# Execute step-1
sudo ./updater step-1
sudo poweroff

# Turn your Pinebook Pro on again, then run step-2
sudo ./updater step-2 iso
sudo poweroff

# Turn it on again, then update to the revised ISO firmware
sudo ./updater flash-kb firmware/default_iso.hex
```
